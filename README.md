## Shunli

Shunli is a learning aid tool that is able to turn speech into text.  It can take Chinese audio recordings, and turn it into a transcript of which a student can study and analyze unfamiliar words.  You can submit recordings from the browser with one's microphone, upload an audio file from one's computer, or even submit a youtube video link.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
